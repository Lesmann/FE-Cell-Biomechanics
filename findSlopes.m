function [Sx, Sy] = findSlopes(vparent, vchildren)

% This function calculates all slopes of linear fit between field-values of
% parent node (vparent) and its children (vchildren).
% in the future, other fitting algorithms will be investigatd.

lchild = length(vchildren);

for i = 1 : lchild
    
    vchild = vchildren(i);
