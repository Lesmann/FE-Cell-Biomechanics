function [ Res ] = BCE_Analysis( Data )

% This function Analyses displacement data of Bulk-Control experiments (BCE) models and
% generates the following graphs according to the BCE Type:
% 1. Poisson's ratio vs. axial strain for uniaxial Tension/Compression BCEs.
% 2. Normal vs. shear strain for Shear loading BCEs.
